# Basic C and C++ Beginner and Tricky Codes

This repository contains some basics programming practices in c and c++
programming language. All the codes are categorized in sub-folders according to
same type, pattern and chapter.

Current directories:

* basics
* strings
* arrays
* patterns and pyramids
* recursion
* advanced

## Basics

This directory contains some basic knowledge and house keeping stuffs of c and
c++ programming language.

## Strings

This directory contains only codes of **STRING** library of c and c++
programming language. All the utilizations of necessary **STRING** standard
library functions have been added here. Such as:

`gets()` `puts()` `strlen()` `strcat()` `strcpy()` `strcmp()` `strrev()`

## Arrays

This directory contains some basic knowledge and example codes of arrays. such
as data `insertion`, `deletion`, `sorting` and so on.

## Patters and Pyramids

This directory contains some codes of different patterns and pyramids like
`normal pyramid`, `reversed pyramid`, `diamond patter` and so on.

## Recursion

This directory contains some codes using recursion like finding `factorial`,
`reversed number` and some `series mathematics`

## Advanced

This directory contains some analytically and mathematically advanced codes in c
programming language such as finding `prime number`, `prime factors`, `perfect
number`, `leap year` and so on.
